This Power BI project provides insights into the sales data of a superstore. It includes visualizations for sales by segment, category, subcategory, ship mode, region, and quarter.

The dashboard allows you to analyze sales trends, identify top-performing products and categories, and compare sales across different regions and segments.

Sales by Ship Mode: Shows the distribution of sales using different shipping methods (e.g., first class, standard).
Sales by Region: Analyzes sales performance across different regions (e.g., West, East, South, Central).
Sales by Quarter: Tracks sales trends over time (e.g., quarterly sales).
This dashboard is a helpful tool for anyone interested in analyzing sales data and gaining insights into customer buying behavior.
